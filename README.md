### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here's a small selection of personal projects I've got hosted in Github:

* [WebGL Mandelbrot Renderer](https://github.com/rm-hull/mandelbrot) - A small frontend app written in Typescript
  using React and WebGL to display the Mandelbrot set, where the calculations are offloaded to the GPU for better
  performance, deployed with Github Actions and hosted via Github Pages.

* [Calendar](https://github.com/rm-hull/calendar) - A simple single-page app written in Typescript using React that
  just displays a calendar for the next 12 months, deployed with Github Actions and hosted via Github Pages. Shows
  public holidays for your locale (if the data is present) and link  with a Wikimedia API to show events, births &
  deaths for every day.

* [UK Ordnance Survey maps](https://github.com/rm-hull/maps) - A small frontend app written in Typescript
  using React, Chakra UI and Leaflet.js, deployed with Github Actions and hosted via Github Pages. Interfaces
  with OS Data APIs and Geograph API to enrich the map with local points-of-interest.

* [Zaup 2.0](https://github.com/rm-hull/zaup2) - Another frontend app (also Typescript, React, Chakra) that
  displays imported TOTP codes. It is another "serverless" app - all the data is persisted in local storage
  (and AES encrypted). Syncs data with Google Drive.

* [Asteroids](https://github.com/rm-hull/asteroids) - A golang implementation of the classic arcade game that
  cross-compiles into WASM so you can play it in a browser.

  miscellaneous notes as "blocks" in your browser's local storage.
