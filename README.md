### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here's a small selection of personal projects I've got hosted in Github:

* [UK Ordnance Survey maps](https://github.com/rm-hull/maps) - A small frontend app written in Typescript
  using React, Chakra UI and Leaflet.js, deployed with Github Actions and hosted via Github Pages.

* [Zaup 2.0](https://github.com/rm-hull/zaup2) - Another frontend app (also Typescript, React, Chakra) that
  displays imported TOTP codes. It is another "serverless" app - all the data is persisted in local storage
  (and AES encrypted)

* [Asteroids](https://github.com/rm-hull/asteroids) - A golang implementation of the classic arcade game that
  cross-compiles into WASM so you can play it in a browser.
